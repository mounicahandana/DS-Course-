In this document i would like to mention about OOPS Concept in Python 

IN OOP(Object oriented programming )there are mainly 6 concepts 

1. CLASS : class is like a blueprint of object 
          
          for example : fruit is a blueprint whereas apple,banana etc are objects.
          Syntax      :  def ClassName:
    

2. OBJECT: it is a physical entity b using object we can access all functions and variables in a specific class

            Syntax : Objname=ClassName()
    

3.POLYMORPHISM : It can contain many forms poly means many

4.INHERITANCE : The process of getting properties and functions from parent to child class 

                    parent class (base class, superclass)
                    child class(derived class)
                
                There are many types of inheritance like 
                1.SINGLE INHERITANCE : single parent and child class
                2.MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE : Single parent and more child classes
                3.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE : Two parents and one child class
                4. HIEREARCHAL INHEITANCE : one parent and two childrens like siblings

5. Data Abstraction :  The process of hiding the functionaltyy and showing the implementation is calles Abstraction
 
                        For example :  when we apply brake in car we r not aware of what happening inside but we know the implementation.


6.ENCAPSULATION    : The process of wrapping variables(data memebers) and methods(functions) together is called encapsulation.

                      There are three access modifiers to discuss . we use this whenever we want to hide the data . 

                      1. PUBLIC : This public class can be accessed by everone . By default ever class is public
                      2. PRIVATE : This class is private. No class can access this .
                      3. PROTECT : Here comes INHERITANCE LIKE if i keep any class protect then the child class of that protect class can only access the content of the protect class.
